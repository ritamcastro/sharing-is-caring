# require("lx") 

[require("lx")](https://www.meetup.com/require-lx/) is comunity for JavaScript developers in Lisbon. 

They had their [Summer Edition](https://www.meetup.com/require-lx/events/293843730/) at the SDC:LX Auditorium and I had the pleasure to be one of the speakers. 

The title of the talk was *Accessibility and Test Driven Development - a match made in heaven* and a good summary of it is: 
"Here's a example on how you can leverage the power of HTML semantics and roles to test your application right from the start. Say goodbye to the excuse that ‚Äúbut I am no a11y expert, how can I do this?‚Äù. All you require is the first step. And this could be it."
