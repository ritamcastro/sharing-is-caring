This was the abstract for the talk.

**Building the Right Product and Building It Right: A Glimpse into Extreme Programming, Atomic Design and Micro Frontends.**

> Have you heard about Atomic Design? How about Extreme Programming and Test-Driven Development? For sure you have heard about React - a few things, I bet. How about Micro-frontends?
>
> In this talk you will get some insight on leveraging the power of Atomic Design to build the right product (using React) and capitalize on Extreme Programming and Test-Driven Development to build it right (by exploring the React Testing Library) and use the Micro-frontends pattern to scale it beyond the scope of a Minimum Viable Product.
