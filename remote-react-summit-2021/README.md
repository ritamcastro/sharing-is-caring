# Remote React Summit 2021

Welcome!

The [Remote React Summit 2021](https://remote.reactsummit.com/) tookplace in April 2021. Between 14th and 16th we've had 3 amazing days of talks, networking and sun.

I have presented a small talk that went like this.

```
Building the Right Product and Building It Right: a Glimpse into Extreme Programming and Atomic Design

Have you heard about Atomic Design? How about Extreme Programming and Test Driven Development? For sure
you have heard about React - a few things, I bet. In this talk you will get some insight on leveraging 
the power of Atomic Design to build the right product (using React, duh!) and capitalize on Extreme 
Programming and Test Driven Development to build it right (by exploring the React Testing Library).
```

You can find the slides [here](https://github.com/ritamcastro/sharing-is-caring/blob/main/remote-react-summit-2021/A_glimpse_into_XP_and_Atomic_design.pdf).
