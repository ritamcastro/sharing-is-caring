# React Advanced 2021

Welcome!

[React Advanced](https://reactadvanced.com/) took place in October 2021 in London and all around the world. Between 21st and 25th we've had 2 days of amazing days of talks, networking and learning.

I have presented a small talk that went like this.

```
To Mock or Not to Mock - That's the Question

To mock or not to mock, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler for the code of the programmers to engage with spies and stubs in outrageous tests, or to take the real components against a sea of timeouts, and by enduring, to validate their code: to commit, to push.
```

You can find the slides [here](https://github.com/ritamcastro/sharing-is-caring/blob/main/react-advanced-2021/to_mock_or_not_to_mock.pdf) and the repo [here](https://github.com/ritamcastro/react-advanced-bookkeeper).
